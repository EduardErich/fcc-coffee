# FreeCodeCamp first CSS lesson
The objective of this lesson was to create a webpage with a little bit more of stylization. 

## Goals
Instead of a simple, white blank page with text oriented on left margin, this little study-project intended to create a cafe menu with an image on background, text and image center-aligned, change the font style and create more interation with links when clicking or hovering over it. The structure of the menu text itself also received a background, pushing it from the image of the body background, making it more pleasent to look at and easier to read too. 

Some other functions not covered in the actual lesson were studied from researches, like how to prevent the background to move while you scroll down or up, how to round the borders and how to make an element more transparent (opacity).

## Final thoughts
Once again, it's a pretty basic and introductory project. It's not so flashy but compared to the [TOP html recipe project](https://github.com/EduardErich/odin-recipes), which final result can be seen [here](https://eduarderich.github.io/odin-recipes/), it already pops out much more and looks a little bit more interesting too.  
The final result can be seen [right here](https://eduarderich.github.io/fcc-coffee/).
